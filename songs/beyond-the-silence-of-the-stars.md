## Lyrics

```
[Intro]
[Mood: Triumphant]
[Energy: Medium]
[Instrument: Orchestral strings, deep reverse bass kick, ambient pads]
[Instrumental, 8 bars]

[Verse 1]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
[Energy: Medium]
Beyond the silence of the stars
I heard a voice across the dark
A signal burning through the void
A universe I can't avoid

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Power]
Feel it pulling me beyond
Every constellation drawn
Into the light we don't yet know
Three, two, one, let go

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Vocal Style: Belt]
[Drop]
We are STARDUST, born to COLLIDE
Racing through the endless sky
(Through the sky, through the sky)
Supernovas in our veins
WE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME

[Build]
[Instrumental, 4 bars]
[Energy: Rising]

[Verse 2]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
[Energy: Medium]
Gravity could never hold
The fire burning in my soul
Every heartbeat shakes the ground
Cosmic thunder, epic sound

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Power]
Feel it pulling me beyond
Every constellation drawn
Into the light we don't yet know
Three, two, one, let GO!

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Vocal Style: Belt]
[Drop]
We are STARDUST, born to COLLIDE
Racing through the endless sky
Supernovas in our veins
WE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME

[Bridge]
[Mood: Triumphant]
[Energy: High]
[Instrument: Full orchestra, euphoric synth lead]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
Can you feel the universe
Breathing ~through~ us now
(Through us now)

[Buildup, 8 bars]
[Energy: Rising]

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Vocal Style: Belt]
[Drop]
WE ARE STARDUST, BORN TO COLLIDE!
RACING THROUGH THE ENDLESS SKY!
(Born to collide!)
SUPERNOVAS IN OUR VEINS
WE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!

[Outro]
[Energy: Medium]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
[Instrument: Ambient pads, fading reverse bass]
Stardust... born to collide...
[Fade Out]
```

## Generation Tips

- Generate 3-4 versions and pick the one with the cleanest kicks and best vocal clarity
- If the drop lacks impact, regenerate - V5 handles hardstyle kicks well but can vary
- Remaster (Subtle) after selecting your best version for polish
- If it comes out too short, use Extend with callback: "continue with same euphoric hardstyle vibe and cosmic theme"
- The UPPERCASE lines should come through as emphasized/shouted -- if they don't hit hard enough, try a Cover with a different vocal persona
