[Verse 1]
[Vocal Style: Rap]
[Energy: High]
[Vocal Effect: Auto-tune]
Skip bee, waste of time, waiting on the stream
Lacari where you at? I'm living in a dream
Three hours in the queue, link the website, link the soul
Steam refunded Ashes, W Gaben, lose control!

Rugpulled and boom, refund EZ, then they quit
Friends all left the server, I'm over all of it
Bedge in the chat, lil gup yuh, aintnoway
On god, frfr, what's the move today?

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
I hope there's ascensions, add 'em from the start
Slay the Spire 2, Strongge
Playing with my heart!

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Drop]
[Vocal Effect: Auto-tune]
GAMING! WIDENESSIE EDM, CRANK IT LOUD!
ABOBA in the rafters, offline chatter crowd!
It's a wideNessie SPEED, it's a wideNessie VIBE!
Journey mode is trash, how do bozos even thrive?
YEP, YEP, everything is true and real
Machine combat combat, that's the only way I feel
ICANT, I FOCKING CANT, LMAO

[Vocal Effect: Auto-tune]
B-b-b-bozos in the chat, yeah that's a red flag
Stole my ribbon? Madge. Put 'em in a bag
RE2, RE4, yeah the movement is atrocious
K&M is wonky but the gunplay is precocious

Clair story done, Leon's in the bin
Addicted to the remake, let the horror sink in
Nyxxi likes milfs? YEP, she told me so
Forbidden West is Disney tier, combat's all I know

[Build]
[Energy: Rising]
I had so much ammo, boss stood no chance
Died once to the first
Then I did the emote dance!

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]

[Bridge]
[Mood: Dark]
[Energy: Low]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Instrument: Eerie synth melody, stripped breakbeat]
Bark. Bark. UHM... Starege.
Why we putting pylons on the surface, bro?
Dark difficulty brain, nowhere to go
Molten armor and a worm, you can't die
Mining copper, skipping silver? No way, why?

[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Belt]
IT'S RIGHT THERE! HAHAHAHA!
Average autism dono, LOLW, ICANT
The Quin files Aware...

[Verse 3]
[Vocal Style: Rap]
[Energy: High]
[Vocal Effect: Auto-tune]
One-shot the elite, Turn 1, Act 3
Golden critters spawning, that's the luck for me
Drill module out, spray the biome, make it clean
Good riddance easy with the hundred percent machine

Stake's taking long? Paineg. Workshop world? EZ
I'm a journey mode hater, don't @ me please
Dark Souls 4 Prayge, give the fans what they want
Not buying a Switch, that's a billion-dollar flaunt

[Build]
[Energy: Rising]
Timed out for a hundred? Smile, it's a gift
Six lenses in the altar
Feel the paradigm shift!

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Vocal Style: Belt]
[Drop]
GAMING! WIDENESSIE EDM, CRANK IT LOUD!
ABOBA IN THE RAFTERS, OFFLINE CHATTER CROWD!

[Outro]
[Energy: Low]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Vocal Effect: Delay]
[Instrument: Bitcrushed slowing breakbeat, fading synths]
Fat LMAO... Fat LMAO...
At the end of the day
It's the end of the day

Chur bozo
(wideNessie~)
YEP!
[End]

## Generation Tips

- Generate 3-4 versions and pick the one with the most euphoric synths and hardest-hitting DnB breaks
- The pitched-up chipmunk vocals are essential -- if the voice is too normal/deep, try a Cover with "pitched-up female" emphasis
- The "GAMING!" shout at chorus drops needs to hit like a rave anthem -- if it's weak, regenerate
- The glitch stutter on "B-b-b-bozos" in Verse 2 should sound choppy and digital -- Suno usually nails this naturally
- The bridge needs to strip down to eerie whisper then EXPLODE back with "IT'S RIGHT THERE!" -- if the contrast isn't dramatic enough, use Replace Section
- 174 BPM is non-negotiable -- if it sounds slower, regenerate
- The outro should bitcrush and slow down, then "YEP!" cuts to dead silence -- use Crop if it trails
- Use Extend with callback if too short: "continue with same happy hardcore DnB manic gaming energy"
- Remaster (Subtle) after selecting best version
