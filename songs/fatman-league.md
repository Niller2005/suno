## Generation Tips

- Generate 3-4 versions and pick the one with the hardest kicks and best bass mutations
- The spoken word verses should sound processed/dark -- if too clean, try a Cover with vocoder persona
- The chorus needs maximum aggression with the UPPERCASE shouted lines hitting hard on the drop
- If the psychedelic breakdown in the bridge section doesn't have enough Middle Eastern flavor, regenerate
- Use Extend with callback if too short: "continue with same psytrance acid bass energy and chaotic chat anthem vibe"
- Remaster (Subtle) after selecting best version
- The outro fade should have echoing delay on "Orm... Smile... Fuh..." -- if missing, try Replace Section on just the outro

## Lyrics Changes Log

Light cleanup from original:
- Fixed syllable counts for better vocal alignment (6-12 per line)
- Broke "Orm, Smile, docnotL in the mix" flow to scan with the beat
- Cleaned "quinEatingHisMic" to "quin eats his mic" for singability
- Cleaned "SHADDDAFFFAAKKKKAAAAAAA" to shorter "SHADDDAFFFAAKKKKAAAA" for vocal delivery
- Moved "@fatflupbot" to "At fatflupbot" for vocal clarity
- Kept all explicit language, memes, inside jokes, and chat energy intact
- Added psytrance-appropriate structure (builds, drops, instrumental breaks)
- All original references preserved: PoE, HL3, Gabe, all usernames, all emotes
