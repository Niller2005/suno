[Intro]
[Mood: Dark]
[Energy: Low]
[Instrument: Glitched sub-bass, bitcrushed percussion, granular textures]
[Instrumental, 4 bars]
[Vocal Style: Spoken Word]
[Vocal Effect: Distortion]
In the chat, there's only one rule...
Last pudding standing.

[Verse 1 - Semieza]
[Vocal Style: Rap]
[Vocal Effect: Distortion]
[Energy: Medium]
[Instrument: Halftime drums, glitched-out bass, detuned stabs]
Yo I spotted it first on the table
Chocolate pudding, mhm, I'm more than able
Fifteen trill DPS, you think you can take it?
Defekter bob, you couldn't even fake it
I got elimination pedigree on my spoon
City seven cleared, I'll eat it soon
Don't do it without me? NAH, I do it alone
This pudding is MINE, this is my throne

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Effect: Vocoder]
eavEat? You wanna eat? Hhhehehe

Orange FAT is just FAT, that's a fact
But this pudding right here? Semi's snack

[Chorus]
[Energy: High]
[Drop]
[Vocal Style: Power]
[Vocal Effect: Distortion]
PUDDING FIGHT, PUDDING FIGHT

[Vocal Effect: Distortion]
[Energy: Medium]
[Instrument: Heavy glitch hop chops, distorted sub-bass, bitcrushed snares]
DEFEKTING! DEFEKTING! DEFEKTING!
I've been starving while you were texting
eavEat Semieza, that's what I said
I'll eat the pudding AND the bread
catLick catLick catLick the bowl
vulpRant mode, I'm losing control
You got fifteen trill? I got appetite
Okayeg hungry, I will BITE

vulpHappie when I eat the last

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Power]
[Vocal Effect: Vocoder]
You think you're tough with your DPS test?
I'll eat this pudding from east to west
Bob all you want, I don't give a damn
This dessert is MINE, that's the plan

[Chorus]
[Energy: High]
[Drop]
[Vocal Style: Power]
[Vocal Effect: Distortion]
PUDDING FIGHT, PUDDING FIGHT

[Mood: Dark]
[Energy: Low]
[Instrument: Sub-bass drone, granular textures, sparse bitcrushed clicks]

The pudding hits the floor...
Chocolate everywhere...
Two warriors staring down...
At the mess they couldn't share...

[Energy: Rising]
[Buildup, 8 bars]
[Instrument: Rising granular synth, accelerating halftime drums, glitched bass building]
Wait... there's still a piece...
ONE... LAST... BITE...
WHO WANTS IT MORE?!

[Final Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Drop]
[Vocal Style: Belt]
[Vocal Effect: Distortion]
PUDDING SPLAT, PUDDING SPLAT!
Semi dove and Defekter dove flat!
Headfirst into chocolate on the ground
LICKING every crumb that can be found!

DEFEKTING! Mhm! DEFEKTING! Bob!
Two grown gamers, what a mob!
PUDDING WAR, nobody won!
Both face down, the pudding's DONE!

[Outro]
[Energy: Low]
[Vocal Style: Spoken Word]
[Vocal Effect: Delay]
[Instrument: Fading granular textures, slowing halftime beat, decaying sub-bass]
Semieza: ... was it worth it?
Defekter: ... vulpBruh
Semieza: ... mhm
Defekter: ... same time tomorrow?
(Both): Hhhehehe... hehefat
[End]
```

## Generation Tips

- Generate 3-4 versions and pick the one where the glitch hop / midtempo / deconstructed club elements blend most naturally
- The Semieza verse should sound more calculated and confident, the Defekter verse more chaotic and aggressive -- try different vocal tones if they sound too similar
- The bridge fight section needs rapid back-and-forth between two voices -- if it blends together, try Cover with clearer vocal separation
- The breakdown after the fight needs to feel like a dramatic pause -- stripped percussion, whispered vocals, tension before the final explosion
- The buildup with "WHO WANTS IT MORE?!" should escalate from silence to maximum energy before the final drop
- The outro "same time tomorrow?" should land with comedic timing -- let the pause breathe before the shared "Hhhehehe... hehefat"
- If the glitch textures aren't prominent enough, emphasize "bitcrushed percussion, granular synths" in the style prompt
- Use Extend with callback if too short: "continue with same glitch hop midtempo deconstructed club chaos and pudding fight energy"
- Remaster (Subtle) after selecting best version
- The "(hehefat, hehefat, hehefat!)" backing vocals in the chorus should be glitched and rhythmic
