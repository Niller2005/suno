## Lyrics

```
[Intro]
[Mood: Dark]
[Energy: Medium]
[Instrument: Chopped amen break, swing brass stab, rising synth]
[Instrumental, 4 bars]
[Vocal Style: Spoken Word]
[Vocal Effect: Reverb]
In the chat, there's only one rule...
Last pudding standing.

[Verse 1 - Semieza]
[Vocal Style: Rap]
[Energy: High]
[Instrument: Chopped amen break, acid bass]
Yo I spotted it first on the table
Chocolate pudding, mhm, I'm more than able
Fifteen trill DPS, you think you can take it?
Defekter bob, you couldn't even fake it
I got elimination pedigree on my spoon
City seven cleared, I'll eat it soon
Don't do it without me? NAH, I do it alone
This pudding is MINE, this is my throne

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Effect: Auto-tune]
eavEat? You wanna eat? Hhhehehe
I'm the one who's hungry, can't you see
Orange FAT is just FAT, that's a fact
But this pudding right here? Semi's snack

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Drop]
[Vocal Style: Power]
PUDDING FIGHT, PUDDING FIGHT
Who gon' take it, LEFT or RIGHT?
DEFEKTING all your claims tonight
PUDDING FIGHT, it's on SIGHT!
(hehefat, hehefat, hehefat!)

[Verse 2 - Defekter]
[Vocal Style: Rap]
[Energy: High]
[Instrument: Heavy breakcore chops, distorted bass]
DEFEKTING! DEFEKTING! DEFEKTING!
I've been starving while you were texting
eavEat Semieza, that's what I said
I'll eat the pudding AND the bread
catLick catLick catLick the bowl
vulpRant mode, I'm losing control
You got fifteen trill? I got appetite
Okayeg hungry, I will BITE
im Okayeg, but I'm also FAST
vulpHappie when I eat the last

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Power]
You think you're tough with your DPS test?
I'll eat this pudding from east to west
Bob all you want, I don't give a damn
This dessert is MINE, that's the plan

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Drop]
[Vocal Style: Power]
PUDDING FIGHT, PUDDING FIGHT
Who gon' take it, LEFT or RIGHT?
DEFEKTING all your claims tonight
PUDDING FIGHT, it's on SIGHT!
(hehefat, hehefat, hehefat!)

[Bridge - The Fight]

[Energy: Maximum]
[Instrument: Maximum breakcore chaos, swing brass stabs, alarm sounds]
[Vocal Style: Rap]
Semieza: GIVE IT, bob bob bob!
Defekter: DEFEKTING YOUR WHOLE JOB!
Semieza: I need a partner? NOT YOU!
Defekter: vulpBruh, what you gonna do?
Semieza: Stare... back away slow
Defekter: gasp... I WON'T LET GO!
(Both fighting, pudding shaking)
(The table's breaking)

The pudding hits the floor...
Chocolate everywhere...
Two warriors staring down...
At the mess they couldn't share...

[Instrument: Rising synth, accelerating amen break, swing brass building]
Wait... there's still a piece...
ONE... LAST... BITE...
WHO WANTS IT MORE?!

[Final Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Drop]
[Vocal Style: Belt]
PUDDING SPLAT, PUDDING SPLAT!
Semi dove and Defekter dove flat!
Headfirst into chocolate on the ground
LICKING every crumb that can be found!

DEFEKTING! Mhm! DEFEKTING! Bob!
Two grown gamers, what a mob!
PUDDING WAR, nobody won!
Both face down, the pudding's DONE!

[Outro]
[Energy: Medium]
[Vocal Style: Spoken Word]
[Vocal Effect: Delay]
[Instrument: Fading swing brass, slowing amen break, comedic tuba]
Semieza: ... was it worth it?
Defekter: ... vulpBruh
Semieza: ... mhm
Defekter: ... same time tomorrow?
(Both): Hhhehehe... hehefat
[End]

## Generation Tips

- Generate 3-4 versions and pick the one where the genre shifts between breakcore/happy hardcore/electro swing feel natural and fun
- The Semieza verse should sound more calculated and confident, the Defekter verse more chaotic and aggressive -- try different vocal tones if they sound too similar
- The bridge fight section needs rapid back-and-forth between two voices -- if it blends together, try Cover with clearer vocal separation
- The breakdown after the fight needs to feel like a dramatic pause -- stripped percussion, whispered vocals, tension before the final explosion
- The buildup with "WHO WANTS IT MORE?!" should escalate from silence to maximum energy before the final drop
- The outro "same time tomorrow?" should land with comedic timing -- let the pause breathe before the shared "Hhhehehe... hehefat"
- If the electro swing brass doesn't come through, emphasize "brass swing samples" in the style prompt
- Use Extend with callback if too short: "continue with same breakcore happy hardcore electro swing chaos and pudding fight energy"
- Remaster (Subtle) after selecting best version
- The "(hehefat, hehefat, hehefat!)" backing vocals in the chorus should be pitched up and rhythmic
