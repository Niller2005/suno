## Lyrics

```
[Intro]
[Mood: Peaceful]
[Energy: Low]
[Instrument: Atmospheric pads, soft sub bass, gentle breakbeats]
[Instrumental, 8 bars]

[Verse 1]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
[Energy: Medium]
Drifting past the edge of light
Constellations paint the night
Weightless in this endless sea
The universe is calling me

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Open, Confident]
Floating through the atmosphere
Everything is crystal clear
Let the gravity release
Find me in the ~deep~

[Chorus]
[Energy: High]
[Vocal Style: Power]
We are stardust, born to collide
Riding waves across the sky
(Across the sky)
Supernovas in our veins
We will never be the same

[Instrumental]
[Energy: Medium]
[Instrument: Rolling bassline, crisp hi-hats, lush pads]
[Instrumental, 8 bars]

[Verse 2]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Energy: Medium]
Orbiting a distant glow
Somewhere only we would know
Every particle aligned
Two souls tangled, intertwined

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
Floating through the atmosphere
Everything is crystal clear
Let the gravity release
Find me in the ~deep~

[Chorus]
[Energy: High]
[Vocal Style: Power]
We are stardust, born to collide
Riding waves across the sky
(Across the sky, across the sky)
Supernovas in our veins
We will never be the same

[Bridge]
[Mood: Melancholic]
[Energy: Low]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Vocal Effect: Reverb]
Can you feel the universe
Breathing through us now
(Through us now)
[Instrument: Piano, atmospheric pads]

[Build]
[Energy: Rising]
[Instrumental, 4 bars]

[Chorus]
[Energy: High]
[Vocal Style: Power]
We are stardust, born to collide
Riding waves across the sky
Supernovas in our veins
We will never be the same
(Never be the same)

[Outro]
[Mood: Peaceful]
[Energy: Low]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
[Vocal Effect: Delay]
Stardust... born to collide...
[Fade Out]

## Generation Tips

- Generate 3-4 versions and pick the one with the smoothest rolling bassline and clearest vocals
- Liquid DnB should feel flowing and warm -- regenerate if it sounds too aggressive or heavy
- Remaster (Subtle) after selecting your best version for polish
- If it comes out too short, use Extend with callback: "continue with same liquid drum and bass vibe and cosmic theme"
- The bridge should feel intimate and spacious -- if reverb doesn't come through, try a Cover with adjusted vocal effects
