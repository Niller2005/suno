## Lyrics

```
[Intro]
[Mood: Dark]
[Energy: Medium]
[Instrument: Deep sub bass, shuffled garage beat, time-stretched vocal chop]
[Instrumental, 4 bars]
[Vocal Effect: Vocoder]
(Dubi dubi doo...)
(Dubi dubi doo...)

[Verse 1]
[Vocal Style: Rap]
[Energy: Medium]
Five trill DPS, hit the dummy cap
Semieza in the chat, "mhm" on the map
Orangessfat grindin', armor stackin' up
Two-fifty K and it's still not enough

Deep space beacons, twenty-eight FE
Farming all these maps, the loot's a scam to me
Kismets on the drop, doro on the pull
Hard pity sixty-five, the crystal bag is full

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
Glisum, markenzy, DICI in the mix
Dubious cucumber, who you tryna fix?
Fuh u, fuh u, fuh u and you
Shut the fuck up, we got work to do

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Drop]
[Vocal Effect: Auto-tune]
DUBI DUBI DOO, we grindin' through the night
(Dubi dubi doo)
City seven, SS twenty, hold it tight
Fifteen trill on the DPS, feelin' right
In the chat we don't sleep, we just FIGHT

[Instrumental]
[Energy: High]
[Instrument: Rolling bass, organ stab, garage shuffle]
[Instrumental, 4 bars]

[Verse 2]
[Vocal Style: Rap]
[Energy: Medium]
Sandlord pet, passive income on the side
Dream enchants ten K, kiss that FE goodbye
Vorax chest was eight K, prices comin' down
Armor stacker build, the fattest in the town

Saimaluco barkin', nerpnerp in the back
Painan fix ya bot, the whole thing's out of whack
Is rust written in rust? Ask the fatflupbot
Orange fatty body shape, that emote is hot

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
Eww, league talk, eww, get it out
Bark bark bark, that's what chat's about
Fuh bozos, fuh sen, fuh the lot
This chat lacks vibes but it's all we got

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Drop]
[Vocal Effect: Auto-tune]
DUBI DUBI DOO, we grindin' through the night
(Dubi dubi doo)
City seven, SS twenty, hold it tight
Fifteen trill on the DPS, feelin' right
In the chat we don't sleep, we just FIGHT

[Bridge]
[Mood: Dark]
[Energy: Medium]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Instrument: Deep bass, stripped garage beat]
Polymarket bets on Jesus comin' back
Pringles pulled from Turkey, life is under attack
Half a kilo chestnuts, borg and kofte too
Peel me a pomegranate, nrpHD thank you

[Build]
[Energy: Rising]
Replicator gone and the mirror's on the wall
House of Mirrors card, gamba'd through it all
Uber uber elder, one more run to go
Seven-seven-seven, watch the currency flow

[Buildup, 4 bars]
[Energy: Rising]

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Vocal Style: Belt]
[Drop]
DUBI DUBI DOO, WE GRINDIN' THROUGH THE NIGHT!
(Dubi dubi doo!)
CITY SEVEN, SS TWENTY, HOLD IT TIGHT!
FIFTEEN TRILL ON THE DPS, FEELIN' RIGHT!
IN THE CHAT WE DON'T SLEEP, WE JUST FIGHT!

[Outro]
[Energy: Medium]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
[Vocal Effect: Delay]
[Instrument: Fading sub bass, garage shuffle fading]
This chat lacks positive vibes...
(Smile now... Smile...)
Dubi dubi ~doo~...
Fuh real, fuh real...
(Mhm... danki... mhm...)
[Fade Out]

## Generation Tips

- Generate 3-4 versions and pick the one with the deepest rolling bass and tightest 2-step shuffle
- The "dubi dubi doo" hook needs to be catchy and pitched -- if it's flat, try a Cover with a pitched female vocal persona
- Speed garage lives and dies by the bass and shuffle feel -- if the beat sounds too straight/4x4, regenerate
- The chopped vocal samples in the intro and chorus should feel time-stretched and UK garage-flavored
- Use Extend with callback if too short: "continue with same speed garage bass and shuffled beat energy"
- Remaster (Subtle) after selecting best version
- If the organ stabs are missing, add "prominent organ stabs" to the style prompt and regenerate
