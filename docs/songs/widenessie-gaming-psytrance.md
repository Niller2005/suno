[Verse 1]
[Vocal Style: Spoken Word]
[Energy: Medium]
[Vocal Effect: Reverb]
Skip bee, waste of time, waiting on the stream
Lacari where you at? I'm living in a dream
Three hours in the queue, link the website, link the soul
Steam refunded Ashes, W Gaben, lose control!

Rugpulled and boom, refund EZ, then they quit
Friends all left the server, I'm over all of it
Bedge in the chat, lil gup yuh, aintnoway
On god, frfr, what's the move today?

[Build]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
I hope there's ascensions, add 'em from the start
Slay the Spire 2, Strongge
Playing with my heart!

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Vocal Style: Power]
[Drop]
GAMING! WIDENESSIE EDM, CRANK IT LOUD!
ABOBA in the rafters, offline chatter crowd!
It's a wideNessie SPEED, it's a wideNessie VIBE!
Journey mode is trash, how do bozos even thrive?
YEP, YEP, everything is true and real

B-b-b-bozos in the chat, yeah that's a red flag
Stole my ribbon? Madge. Put 'em in a bag
RE2, RE4, yeah the movement is atrocious
K&M is wonky but the gunplay is precocious

Clair story done, Leon's in the bin
Addicted to the remake, let the horror sink in
Nyxxi likes milfs? YEP, she told me so
Forbidden West is Disney tier, combat's all I know

I had so much ammo, boss stood no chance
Died once to the first

[Mood: Dark]
[Energy: Low]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Instrument: Deep acid bass, Middle Eastern melody, psychedelic pads]
Bark. Bark. UHM... Starege.
Why we putting pylons on the surface, bro?
Dark difficulty brain, nowhere to go
Molten armor and a worm, you can't die
Mining copper, skipping silver? No way, why?

[Energy: Rising]

[Vocal Effect: Vocoder]
One-shot the elite, Turn 1, Act 3
Golden critters spawning, that's the luck for me
Drill module out, spray the biome, make it clean
Good riddance easy with the hundred percent machine

Stake's taking long? Paineg. Workshop world? EZ
I'm a journey mode hater, don't @ me please
Dark Souls 4 Prayge, give the fans what they want
Not buying a Switch, that's a billion-dollar flaunt

[Build]
[Energy: Rising]
Timed out for a hundred? Smile, it's a gift
Six lenses in the altar
Feel the paradigm shift!

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Vocal Style: Belt]

Fat LMAO... Fat LMAO...
At the end of the day
It's the end of the day

## Generation Tips

- Generate 3-4 versions and pick the one with the hardest kicks and best acid bass mutations
- The spoken word verses should sound dark and processed -- if too clean, try a Cover with vocoder persona
- The "GAMING!" chorus drops need maximum aggression with the UPPERCASE lines hitting hard on the psytrance drop
- The 8-bar instrumental break after Chorus 1 is where the acid bass should go absolutely unhinged -- if it's tame, regenerate
- The bridge needs Middle Eastern melodic hints over stripped-down acid bass -- this is the Infected Mushroom signature moment
- The "IT'S RIGHT THERE!" scream should contrast sharply with the whispered bridge -- if the dynamic contrast is weak, use Replace Section
- 145 BPM is the sweet spot for this style -- if it drifts too fast or slow, regenerate
- The buildup before the final chorus should be a massive psychedelic wall of sound
- Use Extend with callback if too short: "continue with same psytrance acid bass energy and chaotic gaming anthem vibe"
- Remaster (Subtle) after selecting best version
