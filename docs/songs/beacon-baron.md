## Lyrics

```
[Intro]
[Mood: Dark]
[Energy: Medium]
[Instrument: Deep 808 slide, grime synth stab, rolling hi-hats]
[Instrumental, 4 bars]
[Vocal Style: Spoken Word]
[Vocal Effect: Distortion]
(Ayo nrpHD...)
(You hear that sound?)
(That's flame elementium, bitch...)

[Verse 1]
[Vocal Style: Rap]
[Energy: High]
Fifteen beacons in the bag, I'm the baron
Deep space drops while you dyin' and starin'
Eight percent spawn rate, I'm the chosen one
God of war mechanic, look what I've done

Thirty FE every map, it's a minute flat
Forty second clears, can you handle that?
Rainbow beacon card, yeah I got that too
nrpHD peel me a pomegranate, thank you

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Power]
Twenty-eight FE per beacon, do the math
One-point-three K per hour on my path
You still dyin' to turrets on floor seven
I'm sellin' stacks of beacons, this is heaven

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Drop]
[Vocal Style: Belt]
BEACON BARON, FLAME ELEMENTIUM KING
Sellin' all these beacons, hear the register ring!
FUH U NRPHD, SHUT THE FUCK UP HOE
I make bank while you rage in the chat below!

(nrpMad! nrpMad!)
BEACON BARON, stackin' FE to the sky
Your DPS is dogshit and you wonder why!
Dumbfuck, bitchass, sit the fuck down
I'm the beacon baron, wear the fuckin' crown!

[Verse 2 - nrpHD Response]
[Vocal Style: Raspy]
[Energy: High]
[Mood: Aggressive]
You think you're hot shit with your beacon stash?
Your build is mid, your armor's trash
I'll type so fast your chat will SCROLL
MadChatting, RAGEY, losing control

You fat orange farming little beacons all day
While I'm pushin' content in the real way
City defence seven-fifteen, you can't clear
Carried by Semieza, let me make that clear

[Pre-Chorus - orangessfat Clap Back]
[Vocal Style: Rap]
[Energy: Rising]
Fuh bozos, fuh sen, fuh you too
I stood in fire and I made it through
My HP regens once every ten
But I'm still alive and I'll farm again

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Drop]
[Vocal Style: Belt]
BEACON BARON, FLAME ELEMENTIUM KING!
Sellin' all these beacons, hear the register ring!
FUH U NRPHD, SHUT THE FUCK UP HOE!
I make bank while you rage in the chat below!

(nrpMad! nrpMad!)
BEACON BARON, stackin' FE to the sky!
Your DPS is dogshit and you wonder why!
Dumbfuck, bitchass, sit the fuck down!
I'm the beacon baron, wear the fuckin' crown!

[Bridge - The Rage Escalation]
[Mood: Dark]
[Energy: Medium]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Instrument: Stripped 808, dark grime pads]
nrpHD typin' paragraphs in the chat
Keyboard warrior, imagine that
"You are a luxury nrpHD," I said
Now he's RAGEY, face turnin' red

[Build]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Spoken Word]
Only five beacons this time, that's the worst
But I sold 'em all and I quenched my thirst
Semieza saw the prices, I said watch
After seein' beacon FE, I farm nonstop

[Vocal Style: Power]
[Energy: High]
ARE YOU EVIL DOG OF DEATH NRPHD?
BARK BARK BARK, that's all I see!
STOP BEING A WHINY IDIOT, SIT DOWN
CUNT ASS BITCH, I RUN THIS TOWN

[Buildup, 4 bars]
[Energy: Rising]

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Vocal Style: Belt]
[Drop]
BEACON BARON, FLAME ELEMENTIUM KING!
SELLIN' ALL THESE BEACONS, HEAR THE REGISTER RING!
FUH U NRPHD, SHUT THE FUCK UP HOE!
I MAKE BANK WHILE YOU RAGE IN THE CHAT BELOW!

(NRPMAD! NRPMAD!)
BEACON BARON, STACKIN' FE TO THE SKY!
YOUR DPS IS DOGSHIT AND YOU WONDER WHY!
DUMBFUCK, BITCHASS, SIT THE FUCK DOWN!
I'M THE BEACON BARON, WEAR THE FUCKIN' CROWN!

[Outro]
[Energy: Medium]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Vocal Effect: Delay]
[Instrument: Fading 808, echoing grime stab]
Fuh real, fuh real, fuh in fuh reak...
nrpHD still typin', what a freak...
Beacon baron, flame elementium ~king~...
(mhm... danki... mhm...)
Deal with it, Smile...
[Fade Out]
```

## Generation Tips

- Generate 3-4 versions and pick the one with the heaviest 808 slides and grimiest synth stabs
- The call-and-response between orangessfat and nrpHD is crucial -- if the vocal tone doesn't shift for Verse 2, try a Cover with a different vocal persona for nrpHD's part
- The chorus needs to HIT with maximum aggression on the UPPERCASE lines -- "BEACON BARON" should feel like a war cry
- The bridge whisper section should contrast hard against the final chorus explosion
- If the 808s sound too clean/thin, add "distorted heavy 808" to the style prompt
- Use Extend with callback if too short: "continue with same trap grime beacon baron energy and aggressive taunting vibe"
- Remaster (Subtle) after selecting best version
- The "nrpMad! nrpMad!" ad-libs should hit like punches between chorus lines -- if they're missing, try Replace Section
