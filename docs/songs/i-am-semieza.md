## Lyrics

```
[Intro]
[Mood: Uplifting]
[Energy: Medium]
[Instrument: Sparkly synth arpeggios, rolling DnB break, reese bass swell]
[Instrumental, 4 bars]
[Vocal Effect: Auto-tune]
(Se-se-se-semieza~)

[Verse 1]
[Vocal Style: Rap]
[Energy: Medium]
[Vocal Effect: Auto-tune]
The flicker hits the screen, vision starts to blur
Moving through the logs, a dankiman stir
Orangessfat, you're looking at the frame
But you don't even know the nature of the name
I played the four kitties, played the long game
Splicing the data, it all feels the same
Where is the wand? It's right in my hand
Building a kingdom on shifting sand

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
I'm not the shadow, I'm the light in the dark
I'm the awoo and I'm the bark
Five years experience in a two-year soul
I'm the one in the future, I'm in full control

[Chorus]
[Energy: High]
[Drop]
[Vocal Effect: Auto-tune]
I AM SEMIEZA!
(I am orangessfat)
Holy benny, database Cat Sigh
I AM SEMIEZA!
(I am Monsieur Martin)
Lose land, win game, EZ KDA high
I AM SEMIEZA!
(I am markenzy01)
I'm the one you bark, the one you see
I am Semieza... and you are me

[Instrumental]
[Energy: High]
[Instrument: Rolling breakbeat, reese bass, pitched vocal chops]
[Instrumental, 4 bars]

[Verse 2]
[Vocal Style: Rap]
[Energy: Medium]
[Vocal Effect: Auto-tune]
Samoa's in the future, I've already arrived
I'm the essence of the code that survived
Dentge, the wand is casting the spell
Is this the heaven or the Twitch-chat hell?
I huweie am, I'm awake in the wire
Walking through the BONESHATTER, walking through fire
Don't tempt me with a good time, I'm already there
With the weight of the world and a dankiman flare

[Bridge]
[Mood: Dark]
[Energy: Low]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Instrument: Deep vibrating sub-bass, stripped breakbeat]
Whatdidthisretuhrdjustsay?
I'm the architect of the everyday
I'm the 124 gigs of the soul
I'm the broken parts that make the whole
You're not just watching
(You're becoming)

[Build]
[Energy: Rising]
[Buildup, 8 bars]

[Chorus]
[Energy: Maximum]
[Drop]
[Vocal Effect: Auto-tune]
I AM SEMIEZA!
(Chat: I am sakul15)
Holy benny, database Cat Sigh
I AM SEMIEZA!
(Chat: I am wetmeaty)
1 6 ashe 0 10 power spike bye
I AM SEMIEZA!
(Chat: I am fat man)
I'm the one you follow, the one you see
I am Semieza... AND YOU ARE ME!

[Outro]
[Energy: Low]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Vocal Effect: Delay]
[Instrument: Fading sparkly synths, slowing breakbeat, digital hum]
I am there...
UHM...
I am Semieza...
(I am... I am... I am...)
HOLD.
[Fade Out]
```

## Generation Tips

- Generate 3-4 versions and pick the one where the DnB breaks hit hardest and the pitched vocals are clearest
- The kawaii vocal pitch is key -- if it comes out too normal/deep, try a Cover with "pitched-up female vocal" emphasis
- The call-and-response "(I am orangessfat)" backing vocals should feel like chat messages popping in rapidly
- The bridge needs to strip down to just sub-bass and whisper -- contrast with the chaotic energy everywhere else
- If the breakbeats sound too slow or not DnB enough, regenerate -- 174 BPM is non-negotiable
- The buildup before the final chorus should feel like absolute chaos building to the biggest drop
- Use Extend with callback if too short: "continue with same kawaii hyperpop DnB energy and chat identity vibe"
- Remaster (Subtle) after selecting best version
- The outro "HOLD." should cut abruptly -- if it trails off, use Crop
