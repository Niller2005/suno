## Lyrics

```
[Intro]
[Mood: Dark]
[Energy: Low]
[Instrument: Deep kick, atmospheric pads, filtered noise]
[Instrumental, 8 bars]

[Verse 1]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Energy: Medium]
[Vocal Effect: Delay]
Signals in the static haze
Pulsing through the endless space
Cut me up and rearrange
Every atom, every wave

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
St-st-stardust on my skin
Feel the transmission pulling in
Let it glitch, let it break
Let the whole sky shi-shi-shake

[Chorus]
[Drop]
[Energy: High]
[Vocal Effect: Vocoder]
We are star-star-stardust
Born to co-co-collide
Ri-ri-riding through the sky
(Through the sky, the sky, the sky)
Supernovas in our veins
Ne-never be the same

[Instrumental]
[Energy: Medium]
[Instrument: Deep rolling bass, chopped vocal chops, crisp hi-hats]
[Instrumental, 8 bars]

[Verse 2]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Energy: Medium]
[Vocal Effect: Reverb]
Binary stars in orbit spin
Fragmented but pulling in
Every beat a broken code
Stitched together, overload

[Pre-Chorus]
[Energy: Rising]
[Vocal Style: Soft]
St-st-stardust on my skin
Feel the transmission pulling in
Let it glitch, let it break
Let the whole sky shi-shi-shake

[Chorus]
[Drop]
[Energy: High]
[Vocal Effect: Vocoder]
We are star-star-stardust
Born to co-co-collide
Ri-ri-riding through the sky
(The sky, the sky, the sky)
Supernovas in our veins
Ne-never be the same

[Break]
[Energy: Low]
[Mood: Dark]
[Vocal Style: Whisper]
[Vocal Effect: Distortion]
Can you feel the universe
Bre-bre-breathing through us now
(Through us, through us, through us)

[Build]
[Energy: Rising]
[Buildup, 8 bars]

[Chorus]
[Drop]
[Energy: Maximum]
We are STAR-STAR-STARDUST
Born to CO-CO-COLLIDE
Riding through the endless sky
(Sky, sky, sky, sky)
Supernovas in our veins
Ne-never be the same

[Outro]
[Energy: Low]
[Vocal Effect: Delay]
[Instrument: Filtered kick, ambient pads]
Star... star... stardust...
[Fade Out]
```

## Generation Tips

- Generate 3-4 versions and pick the one where the stutter effects are cleanest
- The st-st-stutter lyrics cue Suno to deliver chopped vocal feel -- if it doesn't come through, regenerate (usually nails it within 2-3 attempts)
- Remaster (Subtle) after selecting your best version for polish
- If it comes out too short, use Extend with callback: "continue with same stutter house vibe and cosmic theme"
- The vocoder effect on the chorus is key -- if it's missing, try a Cover with vocoder emphasis in the style prompt
